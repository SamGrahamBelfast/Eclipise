# Eclipise
This was my final timed assesement for our programming module:

"You have been given some minimal starter code that is currently being developed as part of a menu
driven TV Scheduling System. The system will allow analysis of available data, about TV Programme
Scheduling Data across a number of days and channels.
Not all the requirements have been implemented. It is your task to implement these and raise the
coding standards of all the code."
